CakePHP Cloudinary Component Plugin Documentation
Introduction
The CloudinaryComponent is an open-source plugin for CakePHP which allows you to integrate Cloudinary image and video upload functionality into your CakePHP applications.

Cloudinary is an end-to-end image and video management solution for websites and mobile apps, that provides developers with a cloud-based platform for storing, processing, and delivering images and videos.

This plugin is built on top of the official PHP SDK for Cloudinary.

This documentation will guide you through the installation and usage of the CloudinaryComponent plugin in your CakePHP application.

Installation
To install the CloudinaryComponent plugin, you need to follow these steps:

Install the plugin via Composer by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
composer require cakephp-cloudinary/cakephp-cloudinary
Load the plugin in your config/bootstrap.php file by adding the following code:
arduino
Copy code
Plugin::load('CakeCloudinary', ['bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => true]);
Create a configuration file for Cloudinary in your config/app.php file by adding the following code:
arduino
Copy code
'Cloudinary' => [
    'default' => [
        'cloud_name' => 'your_cloud_name',
        'api_key' => 'your_api_key',
        'api_secret' => 'your_api_secret'
    ]
]
Replace your_cloud_name, your_api_key, and your_api_secret with your own Cloudinary account information.

Usage
After installing and configuring the plugin, you can use the CloudinaryComponent in your CakePHP application. Here are some examples of how to use the component:

Uploading an image asset
To upload an image asset to your Cloudinary account, you can use the upload() method of the component. Here's an example:

bash
Copy code
$image = '/path/to/image.jpg';
$options = [
    'public_id' => 'my_image',
    'folder' => 'my_folder'
];
$response = $this->Cloudinary->upload($image, $options);
In this example, my_image is the public ID of the image and my_folder is the name of the folder in your Cloudinary account where the image will be stored.

Uploading a video asset
To upload a video asset to your Cloudinary account, you can use the uploadVideo() method of the component. Here's an example:

bash
Copy code
$video = '/path/to/video.mp4';
$options = [
    'public_id' => 'my_video',
    'folder' => 'my_folder'
];
$response = $this->Cloudinary->uploadVideo($video, $options);
In this example, my_video is the public ID of the video and my_folder is the name of the folder in your Cloudinary account where the video will be stored.

Uploading any type of file
To upload any type of file to your Cloudinary account, you can use the uploadFile() method of the component. Here's an example:

bash
Copy code
$file = '/path/to/file.pdf';
$options = [
    'public_id' => 'my_file',
    'folder' => 'my_folder'
];
$response = $this->Cloudinary->uploadFile($file, $options);
In this example, my_file is the public ID of the file and my_folder is the name of the folder in your Cloudinary account where the file will be stored.
